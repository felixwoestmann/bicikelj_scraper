# bicikelj scraper

The code in this repository is used to scrape data from the (Ljubljana bike sharing service)[https://www.bicikelj.si/en/mapping] and convert it to data about when and how bikes moved from one station to another station. Those movements are called *journeys* the raw data are called *obervations*.

The script was built as a project for the course Statistical Programming at the university of Ljubljana and works as of 14.12.2022. 

It consists of the scraper and a subsequent script called analysis to convert the observations scraper made to journeys.
